## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

 * Removed single quotes around words in the description.
 
 * Updated the description to not start with the title.
 
 * Added a general reference to analytic element modeling theory in the description field.
 
 * Added a \value field to contours.Rd.
 
 * Removed the setting of graphical parameters using par() in the vignettes.
