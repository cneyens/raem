Description: Analytic element modeling of steady-state single-layer
    groundwater flow. Elements such as wells, area-sinks or line-sinks
    can be placed arbitrarily. The hydraulic head, potential,
    streamfunction, discharge and velocity vector can be computed at any location 
    in the field. Tracelines can be computed numerically in three dimensions.
