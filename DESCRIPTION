Title: Analytic Element Modeling of Steady Single-Layer Groundwater Flow

Description: Analytic element modeling of steady-state single-layer
    groundwater flow under the Dupuit-Forchheimer assumption. Elements
    such as wells, area-sinks and line-sinks can be placed arbitrarily.
    The hydraulic head and discharge vector, as well as other state- and
    flow-variables, can be computed at any location in the field.
    Tracelines can be computed numerically in three dimensions.
