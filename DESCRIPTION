Description: Analytic element modeling of steady-state, single-layer
    groundwater flow under the 'Dupuit-Forchheimer' assumption. Elements
    such as wells, area-sinks and line-sinks can be placed at arbitrary
    locations in the flow field. Output variables include hydraulic head
    and the discharge vector. Particle traces can be computed numerically
    in three dimensions.
